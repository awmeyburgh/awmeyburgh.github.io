## My Philosophy

I believe in writing simple, clean, and maintainable code. My approach to problem-solving is rooted in understanding the problem from an abstract perspective, breaking it down into manageable parts, and then implementing robust and well-tested solutions. I'm a strong advocate for continuous learning, always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills through courses, reading, and hands-on projects.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy philosophing, exploring different schools of thought and pondering the big questions. I also practice meditation to cultivate mindfulness and find inner peace. Additionally, I enjoy gaming, which provides a fun way to unwind and engage with creative storytelling.
